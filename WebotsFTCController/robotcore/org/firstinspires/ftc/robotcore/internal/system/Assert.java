/**
 * {@link Assert} is a utility class for assertions that generates an exception which
 * gets written to the log, but then continues on with the application. The write to the
 * log gives us notices that something is amiss that needs addressing, but continuing with
 * the app might, for example, allow a robot to continue on in a match rather than aborting
 * in the middle, depending on the nature of the failure.
