 * Instances of {@link AngularVelocity} represent an instantaneous body-referenced 3D rotation rate.

 * <p>The instantaneous rate of change of an {@link Orientation}, which is what we are representing
 * here, has unexpected subtleties. As described in Section 9.3 of the MIT Kinematics Lecture below,
 * the <em>instantaneous</em> body-referenced rotation rate angles are decoupled (their order does not
 * matter) but their conversion into a corresponding instantaneous rate of change of a set of
 * related Euler angles (ie: {@link Orientation} involves a non-obvious transformation on two
 * of the rotation rates.</p>
