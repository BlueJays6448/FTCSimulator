/**
 * For hardware devices which are manipulated using a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal,
 * the {@link PwmControl} interface provides control of the width of pulses used and whether
 * the PWM is enabled or disabled.
 *
 * <p>PWM is commonly used to control servos. {@link PwmControl} is thus found as a second
 * interface on servo objects whose primary interface is {@link Servo} or {@link CRServo}
 * when the underlying servo controller hardware supports this fine-grained control (not all
 * servo controllers provide such control). To access the {@link PwmControl} interface,
 * cast your {@link Servo} or {@link CRServo} object to {@link PwmControl}; however, it is
 * usually prudent to first test whether the cast will succeed by testing using <pre>instanceof</pre>.</p>
